      <h2>My approach</h2>
      <p>Because you will be putting a good deal of time and energy into your child’s care, you should choose a psychologist carefully.   I strongly believe you should feel comfortable with the psychologist you choose, and hopeful about the treatment strategy.   When you feel this way, your family’s treatment is more likely to be very helpful to you and your child.   Let me describe how I see my services.</p>
      <p>I think of my approach to helping children, adolescents, and their families with their concerns as an educational one.    Regarding behavioral and/or emotional challenges, I combine two types of treatment called “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy.”  My goal is to help promote positive social development in children through young adulthood.  Social skills development, cognitive-behavioral coping strategies, behavior management, and parenting techniques are an important part of an individual’s development.  Therefore, parents, children, adolescents, and young adults are provided the skills necessary to understand, prevent, cope with, and solve behavioral, social, emotional, and/or academic challenges.</p>
      <p>Relative to my approach to conducting assessments, I strive to provide comprehensive neuropsychological, psychological, and/or psychoeducational evaluations that are tailored to meet the needs of the respective client.  I am able to combine my school system knowledge with my clinical neuropsychological training to provide families with a highly detailed, yet “user friendly” learning analysis.  Strategies are provided that are rooted in, and linked to that specific assessment data.  Essentially, my goal is for each assessment to serve as a “road map” that guides subsequent services, academic supports, coping skills, interventions, etc. that allow individuals to overcome their respective learning challenges.</p>
